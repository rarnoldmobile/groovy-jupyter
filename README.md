Groovy Jupyter Kernel
=====================

Project Goals
-------------

Jupyter (formerly iPython) is a multi-language ide/notebook environment that is useful for data analysis and exploration with data science techniques.

The main goal of this project is to allow the groovy repl to work over the Jupyter notebook interface.


Caveats
-------

This is open source, a work in progress, and is not in any way guaranteed to work.
